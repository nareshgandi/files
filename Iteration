I apologize for the confusion. If `schemaname` is not available directly in your PostgreSQL version, you can use `pg_namespace` to get the schema name. Here's an adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT
  nspname AS schema_name,
  indexrelid::regclass AS index_name,
  indrelid::regclass AS table_name,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size
FROM
  pg_index
JOIN
  pg_class ON pg_class.oid = pg_index.indexrelid
JOIN
  pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid = pg_class.relnamespace
WHERE
  indisvalid = false;
```

This query includes `pg_namespace` to fetch the schema name. Adjust it according to your PostgreSQL version and requirements.
